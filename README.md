# Simply Scheme Exercises

My attempt at solving the exercises in the book 'Simply Scheme: Introducing Computer Science' by Brian Harvey and Matthew Wright available [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html)

Very much a work in progress :)


## TODO

- Finish the exercises in part 16
- Refine/refactor poker.rkt
- Add question text to answers
